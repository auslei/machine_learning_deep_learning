# Deep Learning

This has examples of deeplearning. Something that I have been learning and applying in practice. The contents summarises the fundamentals so hopefully when used again, it can easily rejog my memory. There are a few sections, related to deep learning fundamentals, fine tuning, monitoring as well as different architecture.

1. Keras

- Classification/Regression Models
- Training call backs (early stopping, logging, etc)
- Concatenation

2. Hyper-paramerter tuning
- Tensorboard
- Unstable Gradient
- Optimisors
- Learning rate scheduling
- Regularisaion

3. Customisation
- Transfer Learning
- Custom Models
- TF Data API (pre-trained models, data transformations)

4. Recurrent Neural Nets
- RNN achitecture
- NLP

5. CNN Models
